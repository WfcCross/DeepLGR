# DeepLGR 
In this study, we have revisited the CNN approaches for citywide crowd flow analytics and identified the drawbacks of existing arts. To overcome these challenges, we present a new framework named DeepLGR.

*This is an easy implement of DeepLGR using Pytorch 1.1.0, tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with a RTX 2080Ti GPU.*
